    <p>Music festivals have developed as an industry which contributes to national economies. For example, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival earned $115 million in 2017.[6] Music festivals can be a way of building a brand for a destination, creating a unique image for it and attracting visitors.[7] For example, Lollapalooza, Electric Daisy Carnival Las Vegas, Ultra Music Festival, Electric Forest and others.</p>

        <p>While contemporary festivals are often represented as flourishing grounds for extraordinary experiences,[8] they increasingly serve as a way to create cultural identity, lifestyle, community, belonging and self-actualisation.[9] Furthermore, festivals are a manifestation for creating escapism[10] and a seasonal cultural economy to experience ritually and collectively.[11]</p>
